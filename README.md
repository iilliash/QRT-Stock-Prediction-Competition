Stock Return Prediction Challenge Solution

Overview

This repository contains my solution for QRT's stock return prediction challenge. Given the low signal-to-noise ratio in financial data, extracting meaningful patterns is extremely challenging. To do that, I used feature engineering to create aggregated features reducing the noise in the data.

Challenge Description

The challenge aims to predict the residual return of a stock in the US market using 20 days of historical data, including residual stock returns and relative volumes. The key objective is to predict the sign of a stock's residual return. Data provided includes various features like industry indexes, sector indexes, and historical returns and volumes.
